        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>
          Ing. Karel Malec, Ph.D. has been working at the Department of
          Economics and Management at the Ambis University since 2021. In 2016,
          he defended his doctoral thesis focused on the development of prices
          and volatility of selected agricultural commodities. He continues to
          specialize in this field and publishes professional articles on the
          issue of agricultural commodity prices, trading, and their impact on
          developing countries at conferences and in international scientific
          journals. <br />
          <br />
          Another area of his research is the evaluation of economic efficiency
          using financial analysis methods. Currently, he is involved in
          projects that map the impact of agricultural activities on the water
          balance in the Czech Republic, a project focused on young farmers and
          the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy for the new programming
          period 2021-2027, a project aimed at increasing awareness of
          sustainable practices for students of economic universities, and
          others.. <br />
          <br />
          In terms of teaching, he has extensive experience teaching in both
          Czech and English. In the context of teaching, he has collaborated
          with other universities in the EU (such as WUR Wageningen, FH
          Burgenlad, etc.).
